# Alert model - EHDS Logical Information Models v0.1.0

## Logical Model: Alert model 

 
EHDSAlert means a structured set of data elements describing a clinically relevant fact about a patient that requires attention during a healthcare encounter in order to ensure patient safety or prevent adverse outcomes, including, but not limited to, intolerances, rare diseases requiring special management, implanted devices, ongoing special treatments, transplanted organs, or participation in a clinical trial. 

**Usages:**

* Use this Logical Model: [Discharge Report model](StructureDefinition-EHDSDischargeReport.md) and [Patient summary model](StructureDefinition-EHDSPatientSummary.md)

You can also check for [usages in the FHIR IG Statistics](https://packages2.fhir.org/xig/resource/eu.ehds.models|current/StructureDefinition/StructureDefinition-EHDSAlert.json)
